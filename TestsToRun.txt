# Important patches

Some issues and segmentation faults where discovered during the implementation of the bonuses. These where due to the specifics of how we do not have a environment when running some early on tests. We have fixed these bugs in the latest realease that contains bonuses. The issue was with eatable test and caused by a specific design choice on how statistics where implemented.
